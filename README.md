# data-driven-dashboard

(WIP) This project aims to create a dashboard with no further need of writing adapters/components for your different data sources/models. This way, you can create any dashboard you like, with any data you like, as long as the different charts are specified in the data, fed into the frontend. This goes hand in hand with another project over at [lab9k/apiapi](https://github.com/lab9k/apiapi). You could, for example, use the apiapi to re-model your different data sources into chart components for this dashboard.
